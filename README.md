# lang-translator
This web application facilitates real-time voice translation. Users can select a source and target language, speak in the source language, and receive both the translated text and audio output in the target language. On desktop/laptop devices, users must manually start and stop voice recognition by clicking a microphone icon. On mobile devices, speech recognition automatically stops after the user finishes speaking. The translated content is then displayed as text and played back as audio.
